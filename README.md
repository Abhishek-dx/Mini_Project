Mini Project On Optical Networking
This my mini project for my 3rd semester (Computer science and Engineering) in college.
Objective:
1) To input a given network(as a graph) in a file.
2) Generate 50 random requests from one node to another and find 3 shortest paths for those requests.
3) Assign wavelengths to each path used for handling the requests.
4) Constraint: One path(which is the edge in the graph) can contain a maximum of 3  wavelenghts.
